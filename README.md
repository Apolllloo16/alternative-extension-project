Forbidden Rhythms. 
by William Kavanagh.

A simple rhythm-movement game with a Chrome-dino-inspired intercedent level.

Note: This is not polished, or bug-free. But it (mostly) works. There are thousands of ways in which it can be improved/extended/expanded/remade/rebuilt.

This is an optional project to be extended by CMP105 students for the individual submission starting in week 9.

# Proposal from March

_either keep in full or move to new file_

Proposal was for the group project however i changed over to doing the extension project.
## Brief Overview of game 

in stone the crows the objective of our game is to collectible all the powerups and find the magic spell book hidden somewhere in the level. it is a mystery platformer where things can be hidden anywhere thanks to our cursor and the ability to click things
in the background. for my extension i want to  keep developing these ideas and get them fully implemented while also wanting to add in some new features and add other content to the game to allow for different playstyles for example powerups that give you certain boosts such
as a double jump or even increased health. i also want to go on to add a  combat system to the game that allows the players to fight with the enemies and can a an extra level of difficulty that will make the game more chanllenging 
this also gives me the option to add in custom level difficulities that can scale to the users skills either making it easier or harder. I would also like to try improve on the collion system and make it handle things more smoothly and implement it to work with the 
abilitys.
And if i have time and the abillity to i would really like to make a  custom level builder for the player so they can make there own levels and mysterys for others to solve .

## Must Have Features

_include 2 or more new features that constitute significant extensions on the base project that you will prioritise the implementation of_.

I want to add a level selctor and two levels 

i want to improve the screen slider and the collions to work with the player and there controls and abillitys


* Include one or two sentences describing each.

we cureently onlt have one level in out game i would like to be  able to design a few others for use in our game and a level selctor that allows the play select the level there on.
i want to make the screen scorller work smoother and make it just nicer for the player so it looks nice and make it so that the collions work properly and when they use an abillity for exampole the dash they cant get stuck in walls ot such.

note, we will be expecting all of these to be included, in some form, in the final submission.

## Should Have Features

i should have the addional abillitys linked to the powerups  that are dropped for the player

i should have the ability to attack then enemies so that there is a way to get past them easiliy

_include 2 or more new features that constitute significant extensions on the base project that you will probably implement_.

i should have the addional abillitys linked to the powerups  that are dropped for the player

i should have the ability to attack then enemies so that there is a way to get past them easiliy

* Include one or two sentences describing each.

we have powerups that are dropped such as a boot and that will be linked to unlocking abillity that gives the player a double jump 
i want to add the abillity for the player to attack the enemies and kill them so that they can get past them with a diffrent way instead of having to just jump over them or run past quickly 

## Could Have Features

_include 2 or more new features that constitute significant extensions on the base project that you may implement_.

a weapons system/alternate attacks

add more functionality to the crow

* Include one or two sentences describing each.*
  
add in the ability for the player to find swords and maybe other weapons they can use in combat that help them do more damage and deal with the enemies more easily
make it so the crow has more funtionality than just showing the player the direction and wat to items and other things 

## Wish to Have Features

_include 2 or more new features that constitute significant extensions on the base project that you will not implement unless all others are included_.

i wish to be able to include a custome level editor 

i wish to be able to add a way to share any custom levels

* Include one or two sentences describing each.
  
i would love to be able to add a custom level editor where the player can add in there own platforms and design there own level kinda like super mario maker and the player to be able to create there ownmystereys to be solved this would be very challeging to implement and would require alot of work but with the time would love to try it 
and if i was to be able to succesfully complete that i would love to be able to add a system that allows custome levels to be saved and for the player to be able to export them and send them to friends who can import them to there game
